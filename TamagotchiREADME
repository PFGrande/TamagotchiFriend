Original Purpose:
Project made for the Dev Mission Apprentenship project.
This is a game that lets you care for a virtual pet. The game is
played with an Arduino using a 2 row LCD monitor and 3 buttons.

Game:
When starting the game, the virtual pet can be assigned a 5 letter name.
The virtual pet has two needs: hunger and joy. Both these values deplete over time.
To replenish hunger and joy, different activities can be performed through the menu.
The menu allows the player to: 
    - View an animation that increases joy
    - Feed the pet (Not implemented yet)
    - Play a minigame that allows the player to control the virtual pet
    - Pause the game

Goals of refactoring code:
    - Seperating classes into different files
        - Moving functions involving the display to the DisplayFunctions class
